# Reinforcement-Learning

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on the problem of learning to make decisions in a dynamic environment. In this repository, you will find code related to Dynamic Programming, Value Function Estimation, and Action Value Estimation for the Frozen_Lake environment. 

Dynammic programming is a classical approach to reinforcement problems that can be modeled as Markov Decision Process (MDP) to estimate the Value and Action-Value function for all states in the state space. 

Upcoming project consists of implementing Monte Carlo and TD learning algorithms (i.e., SARSA and Q-learning) for the Taxi-V3 environment on python. 
Documentation on the Taxi-v3 environment can be found here: https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/taxi/
